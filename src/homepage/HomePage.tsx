          You’re always going to encounter a learning curve when 
          you learn something new — it’s one of the requirements to actually learn`ing!
           The frustrations and struggles that come with it are also a requirement.
          The learning curve doesn’t mean that you should quit — as long as you
           face the challenges and work through those frustrations, you will make progress."
